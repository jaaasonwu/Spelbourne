The problem we identified was the obesity problem. We think that the general health of people in
Melbourne is a problem, and after some research, we found that obesity is one of the important factors
that influences people's health. According to source 1, 63.4 percent of Australian
were overweight or obese in 2014, which sees an increase from 56.3 percent in 1995, indicating the
problem is getting worse. 

One cause of the obesity problem is the lack of sport. Many people found it boring and exhausting to do
exercises, but if the sport is a team sport, people might be more willing to be involved. The problem in
team sport is that sometimes it is difficult to find enough people with same interest in one sport.
Our website tries to resolve this by allowing people to find other people nearby who are willing to do
the same sport, and therefore attract more people to get involved in sports, thus making people in
Melbourne healthier.
