We identified poor life-style as the major problem in Melbourne.
The obesity rate in Melbourne is extremely high, according to huffinton post[1],
there are 63.4 percent of Australian were overweight or obese in 2014.
One possible cause of high obesity rate in Melbourne could be the lack of exercise
in the majority population. This view is supported by an extensive
research done by Standford that shown the rise in obesity is linked to the
lack of exercise.

Our team aim to take on the challenge of engaging people in various sport activities,
and thus promoting a healthy living style in Melbourne.

We hypothesize that reason for the lack of willingness to paticipate in sport as follows:
1. Hard to find people with similar interest in the same sport who are also free for group sports
2. Difficulty to coordinate a suitable time slot for sport
3. Steep learning curve for beginners

One opportunity that we could explore would be to create a social web app that allow users
to form groups for players in different level and sports.
